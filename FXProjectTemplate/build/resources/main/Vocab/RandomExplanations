connaître: also means "to experience"
Il a connu le succès. → He experienced success.
Le pays a connu une crise. → The country went through a crisis.

It only means "to experience" in abstract events/situations like success, failure, crisis.
For personally lived experience: vivre (Ils ont vécu la guerre/they lived through a war))

Some adjectives in French make sense only with "se" in front as they describe internal feelings, like se sentir

Celui-ci/celui: this one (mas) Celle-ci/celle: this one (fem)
Ceux: the ones     (mas) Celles: the ones (fem)  
Ceux dont j'ai besoin: the ones that I need

in sentences like "plusieurs pays dont Chine, Canada...", dont means "including"
